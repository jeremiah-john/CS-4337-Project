interpreter.exe is the executable interpreter that was compiled for use on Windows
Interpreter_Linux is the executable that will run on linux and quite possibly other UNIX-based operating systems.
lexer.c & lexer.h contain the code for the lexical analyzer portion of the interpreter

parser.c and parser.h contain the code for the parsing part of the interpreter
symtable.c and symtable.h contain the code for the symbol table array and the functions for adding new symbols to the table and accessing existing symbols for modification.
printtest.txt is a test program that showcases the new features of printing and assigning to variables
test.txt is a simple program that takes user input and uses a simple if-else statement.

the project can be compiled with GCC or any other compiler that handles C code
the command to compile with gcc is:
gcc main.c lexer.c parser.c symtable.c

use the -o flags in gcc to specify the filename of the compiled executable,
otherwise, the new executable may be named "a.out" or something similar
the program only takes one argument: the filename of the file containing the code to interpret
for example in order to run the interpreter on the printtest file, you must go to a commandline
and type:
./interpreter_Linux printtest.txt //for linux, also you can replace "interpreter_Linux" with the name of the program you compiled using gcc
or
interpreter printtest.txt //for windows
